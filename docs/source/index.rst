YOMIX
=====
Yomix is an interactive tool to explore low dimensional embeddings of omics data.

As illustrated in the GIF below, users can explore embeddingsâ€”typically generated using dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP,
t-SNE, TriMap, or VAEs. Within these visualizations, users can identify clusters of interest and use a lasso tool to define specific subsets. 
Yomix can then compute gene signatures for these subsets almost instantaneously. For instance, it can identify gene signatures that best distinguish
subset A from the rest of the data, differentiate subset A from subset B, or find genes whose expression levels are most strongly correlated with a 
user-defined direction within subset A.
